                <h3 style='color:red'>Lambert</h3>
                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Lambert was one of the younger witchers from Kaer Morhen. Known for his biting tongue, he was often rude in conversation. He was particularly rude towards Triss Merigold, addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He does not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality. He helped train Ciri in the art of combat. He was described as being at the same age as Coën. He is one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of Kaer Morhen.<br><br>
                Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.</p>

                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd (in the Elder Speech - the White Flame Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies).
                    His rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors. This led to the outbreak of two wars against the North, both of which are described in the novels. Emhyr var Emreis was an intelligent and brilliant ruler. He chose his people well and crushed all plots against him. He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his goals with great determination.<br><br>
                    He decided that he would offer Ciri the throne as his successor. However, he required help to find her. Having captured Yennefer along the witchers of the Viper School previously, he made her an offer in exchange for her finding Ciri.Provided Geralt brought Ciri to Emhyr and he wins the war, he will name Ciri as his successor. Should Geralt choose not to bring Ciri before the emperor and she survives the White Frost, he will falsely inform the emperor that she had died. Emhyr then tells Geralt that he never wants to see him again.

                <h3 style='color:red'>Keira Metz</h3>
                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Keira Metz is a sorceress originally hailing from Carreras. She is a former advisor to King Foltest of Temeria, a role that has also been held by Triss Merigold and Fercart. She is fond of luxury, despises the dirtiness of the outdoors, and is rather eccentric in nature. She makes aphrodisiacs, and is considered to be a nymphomaniac by Sabrina Glevissig.<br><br>
                During the coup on Thanedd Island, she was thrown from a window by Artaud Terranova. She landed on Geralt of Rivia, who was passing below looking for his former ward, Ciri. Later, Keira became one of the youngest members of the newly formed Lodge of Sorceresses.<br><br> She is first encountered while pretending to be a witch in the village of Midcopse. After spotting Geralt outside her cottage, Keira retreats to a secret, magically-generated chamber. She calls out to Geralt from the top of a magic bath, and, when he arrives, coyly presents the witcher with a view of her nude form.
