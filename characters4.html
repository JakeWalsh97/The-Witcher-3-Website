                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Phillip Strenger, commonly known as the Bloody Baron, is a self-proclaimed baron located in Velen. He took up residence in Crow's Perch after its previous owner, Vserad, fled to Fyke Isle with his family due to the threat of approaching armies.<br><br>
                Strenger served in several wars fighting for Temeria throughout his life meaning he spent a lot of his time away from his family. Upon returning from a war, he discovered that his wife, Anna Strenger, had cheated on him and intended to leave him. In his rage, Strenger had the man murdered and torn to pieces, for which his wife would never forgive him.<br><br>During the conquest of Temeria in the Third Northern War, Strenger realised that resisting Nilfgaard was impractical and declared loyalty to them. In return for his loyalty, the Nilfgaardian emperor appointed Strenger temporary control over Velen from his seat in Crow's Perch.</p>

                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Crach an Craite, also known as Tirth ys Muire ("Sea Boar") and "Wild Boar of the Sea", was a nephew of King Bran of Skellige and was mentored by Eist Tuirseach, king of Cintra. He was described as a broad shouldered youth with a mop of red hair and is known for sometimes showing quite a temper. He was known for his fiery temperament and healthy appetite.<br><br>
                In his early years he was a contender for the hand of Pavetta, Princess of Cintra, however, it never came to anything. After the death of his uncle Eist Tuirseach, who had inherited the throne of King Bran, Crach became the Jarl and thus the ruler of the Skellige Islands.

                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Cerys an Craite, aka "Sparrowhawk", is the daughter of Crach an Craite and Hjalmar's younger sister. The young woman is a courageous islander like her father and has inherited all his stubbornness. She is very self-confident and always ready to prove she can fulfill any task as good as a man can, which causes her and Hjalmar to have a constant, but good-natured, rivalry. However, unlike her brother, she appears more levelheaded, choosing to investigate and think things through first before jumping to conclusions.<br><br>
                Cerys was an islander through and through and the spitting image of her father, having inherited all his courage, resolve and stubbornness. Dauntlessly she sought to prove at every turn that there was no task she could not fulfill as well as – or better than – any man in the islands, including her older brother Hjalmar.
Though Cerys' decision to stake a claim to Skellige's throne came as a shock to everyone else, she had thought it over quite thoroughly beforehand. Striving as always to outdo her brother, she intended to perform a great deed that would earn her widespread recognition and respect.
