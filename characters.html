                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Geralt is a professional monster hunter, or Witcher, as they are called in his world. By way of special training passed down through the ages and violent genetic body mutations undertaken at a young age, Witcher's develop special abilities to aid in their pursuit. Geralt is especially gifted in swordplay. This allows him to easily dispatch multiple groups of foes, be it human or demonic.<br><br>
                The trade-off for this power is that he is rendered infertile. His extremely resilient immune system responded very well to these experiments, prompting his guild masters to subject him to even more dangerous ones that granted him powers far beyond the ken of his peers, although they adversely affected his body's melanin production and made him an albino. <br><br>The combination of his prowess, detached personality, and his appearance have thus earned him the moniker 'Gwynbleidd' (The White Wolf).</p>

                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Yennefer of Vengerberg (born on Belleteyn of the year 1173) — a sorceress who lived in the capital city of Aedirn - Vengerberg. She was the youngest member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and later the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her. She is the love of the witcher Geralt of Rivia and a mother figure to Ciri, a former royal advisor to king Demavend of Aedirn and a close friend of Triss Merigold.<br><br>
                During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.
                Like most sorceresses, she was sterile. She secretly sought a way of restoring her fertility. She gave her motherly love to Ciri — the child destined for Geralt by the Law of Surprise — teaching her about magic while in Ellander, at the Temple of Melitele under the watchful eye of Nenneke.<br><br>

                <p style='font-size:1.15em'>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (known as Ciri or the Lion Cub of Cintra), was born in 1253 or 1252,[1] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She is a Princess of Cintra, and the daughter of Pavetta and Duny. She is the granddaughter of Queen Calanthe.<br><br>After Geralt of Rivia lifted a curse from Duny, the Urcheon of Erlenwald, he demanded from Duny his wife Pavetta's firstborn child, a child he had but didn't know he had, due to the Law of Surprise. Six years to the day after the child's birth, Geralt went back to Cintra for her, but did not take her with him to Kaer Morhen at that time. In fact, he didn't even lay eyes on her and only spoke with Calanthe. The Queen divulged no information to him, not even the child's gender. This child was named Cirilla.<br><br>
                While she was still an infant, Ciri's parents were both lost in a storm at sea. They were presumed dead. She spent her youth in Cintra and the Skellige Islands in the care of her grandmother and her uncle.
